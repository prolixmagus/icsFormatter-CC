# CC - .ics Formatter

This tool is designed to fetch data from Airtable (but can be substituted with your preferred database) and convert the data to .ics format to upload events to a calendar of your choice.

Use a .env file to provide the API Key and credentials you need.

## Roadmap

-   ~~Figure out what data we need for each site.~~
-   Come up with a database schema that maps out the data
-   Custom form with UI (AirTable?) to input data
-   ~~Create a hub page (like link converter) where you can trigger an API to communicate with the database (Push The Button) to generate an .ics file.~~
-   Use this .ics file to communicate with and update all the services (automation? coding?)
